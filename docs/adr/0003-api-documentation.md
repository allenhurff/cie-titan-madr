# ADR 3: API Documentation

## Context and Problem Statement

*   How will you provide documentation for API consumers?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

*   [Documenting Your Existing APIs: API Documentation Made Easy with OpenAPI & Swagger](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/documenting-apis-with-swagger/)

## Considered Options

*   [SwaggerUI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) - Swagger UI allows anyone — be it your development team or your end consumers — to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It’s automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.
* [SwaggerHub](https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/) - The Platform for API Design and Documentation with OpenAPI.
* [graphql-docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-docs) - Dynamically generated documentation explorer for GraphQL schemas. It aims to provide a better overview of a schema than GraphiQL, but without querying features.


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[option 1]", because [justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force force | … | comes out best (see below)].
