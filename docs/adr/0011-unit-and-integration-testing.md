# ADR 11: Unit/Integration Testing

## Context and Problem Statement

*   What tools and approaches would you use to ensure that the code Is not just unit testable, but also that tests are ran often?
*   Give a few examples of how you see the difference of unit tests for the ReadyPitchGo platform versus integration tests.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* [driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
* [driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
* … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

* [option 1]
* [option 2]
* [option 3]
* … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[option 1]", because [justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force force | … | comes out best (see below)].
